## Description: 
This simple library app is part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths).<br>
With it, you can add books, which are stored as objects within an array and displayed in a table, and remove them as well.<br>
The purpose of this project was to get familiar with objects, objects constructors, and prototypes.<br>
Admittedly, it's completely useless at the moment, as the books aren't really stored anywhere and will disappear once the page is reloaded.
~~However, the goal is to fix those issues (once I know how), and make it usable in an upcoming iteration.~~<br>
**Edit: I decided to leave it like this as an evidence of my progress, so when I look back, I can tell how much I've improved.**

- Add a back to top button.
- Add a search bar.
- Add a custom confirmation modal when deleting a book.
- Add a confirmation alert when the read status of a book is changed.
